# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop an application that trains an agent to reach a target using the \textbf{Q-Learning} algorithm.  
Additionally, the project integrates **human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning techniques** to accelerate the convergence of the agent.  

# Key Features

- Implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm for decision-making tasks.  
- Integration of human feedback to guide and speed up learning.  
- Evaluation of the agent's performance using relevant metrics.  
- Modular design to allow experimentation with different reinforcement strategies.
